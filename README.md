# Signal Processing Project â€” Monsoon 2024

This project explores practical applications of signal processing through three key tasks: bird species recognition, heart rate estimation from ECG signals, and loudness-based speech segmentation. All analysis and implementations were done using MATLAB.

## Project Structure

- `Matlab_Code`: Contains all `.m` files for each task.
- `project_details.pdf`.
- `Signals`: Contains signal files used for analysis.

## Tasks

### 1. Bird Recognition
Analyzed time and frequency features from bird calls to classify species using reference and task audio folders.

### 2. Heart Rate Estimation
Extracted heart rate from clean and noisy ECG signals using peak detection and noise filtering techniques.

### 3. Loudness Segmentation
Segmented louder words in speech signals using provided boundaries and explored unsupervised methods without them.

## Tools Used

- MATLAB R2023a
- Signal Processing Toolbox
